The project is dedicated to studying different aspects of semi-supervised learning based on co-train algorithm:  https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~avrim/Papers/cotrain.pdf

Here we answer the following questions:

* How amount of labeled and unlabeled data affects performance of the algorithm?
* How different types of data representation  affects performance of the algorithm? Here we considered only images: raw data represenation, discrete wavelet transformation, fast fourier transformation, HOG features.
* How feature  selection affects performance of the algorithm?
